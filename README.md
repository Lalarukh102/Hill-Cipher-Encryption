# Hill Cipher Encryption

This repository contains a program that encrypts alphabetic letters in a file using the Hill cipher encryption method. The Hill matrix used for encryption can be any size from 2x2 to 9x9. The program accepts two command-line parameters: one for the file storing the encryption key and one for the file to be encrypted.

## Description

The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that uses linear algebra to transform blocks of plaintext into ciphertext. This program implements a generalized Hill cipher where the matrix size can range from 2x2 to 9x9, allowing flexibility in encryption strength.

### Features:
- Encrypts alphabetic characters.
- Supports encryption matrices from 2x2 to 9x9.
- Reads the encryption key and plaintext file as command-line inputs.
- Handles file input/output and formatted ciphertext output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Language:** The program is written in C. Ensure you have a C compiler such as GCC installed on your machine.

### Compiling

To compile the program:

```bash
gcc -o pa01 pa01.c
```

### Running the Program

The program takes two command-line arguments: the path to the file containing the Hill matrix (encryption key) and the path to the file containing the plaintext.

```bash
./pa01 key_file.txt plaintext.txt
```

### Example:

If you have a key file `key.txt` and a plaintext file `plaintext.txt`, run the program as follows:

```bash
./pa01 key.txt plaintext.txt
```

The program will output the encrypted text based on the Hill cipher.

## Usage

1. Prepare a file containing the encryption key (matrix).
2. Prepare a file containing the plaintext to be encrypted.
3. Run the program with the appropriate command-line parameters.

The output will display the encrypted ciphertext, formatted with line breaks every 80 characters.

## File Structure

- `pa01.c` — The main program implementing the Hill cipher encryption.
- `key.txt` — The file containing the encryption key (Hill matrix).
- `plaintext.txt` — The file containing the text to be encrypted.
